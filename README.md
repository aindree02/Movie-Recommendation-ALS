# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System Using Apache Spark ALS

## 📖 Project Overview
This project builds a **Movie Recommendation System** using **Apache Spark's Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm** in **Databricks**.  
It predicts movie ratings and **generates personalized recommendations** based on user preferences.

## 📂 Files in This Repository
- **notebook.py** → Python script of the Databricks notebook.

## 🚀 Features
✔️ Loads and cleans movie rating data.  
✔️ Trains a Collaborative Filtering ALS model.  
✔️ Evaluates model performance using RMSE.  
✔️ Generates personalized movie recommendations.  
✔️ Optimizes the model using Hyperparameter Tuning.  

## 📊 Results
- The best model had **Rank = X** and **RegParam = Y**, with an RMSE of **Z**.  
- The improved model **generated better recommendations** compared to the default parameters.
